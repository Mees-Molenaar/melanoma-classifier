# melanoma-classifier

This is the first machine learned web application that I have made, during following the [fastai course](https://course.fast.ai). And you can use the app [here](https://melanoma-classifier.herokuapp.com/).

The trained model is: `models\melanoma_model.pth`
The notebook: `Homework_Week2_Melonamo_WebApp_V1.ipynb`
The web-app using Flask: `application.py`
I deployed the app using Heroku, which needs these files:
* `.gitignore`
* `Procfile`
* `requirements.txt`
* `runtime.txt`

I used code of different sources:
* Flask documentation
* Fastai course
* Bootstrap documentation
* CS50 course
* [Simon W's Cougar or not project](https://github.com/simonw/cougar-or-not)

The dataset used is the HAM10000 dataset, and can be found [here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DBW86T)

The code and model is not perfect. Therefore, I would love to get feedback if you got any.

Cheers!
